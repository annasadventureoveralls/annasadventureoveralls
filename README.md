            <h2>Fabric Description</h2>
            <p>Cotton duck fabric is a heavy, tightly woven material known for its durability and snag resistance. It is extremely resistant to wear, tear, and abrasion, making it ideal for heavy-duty wear. Its tight weave resists snagging, and if it does snag, the hole tends to stay small.</p>
            <p>Cotton drill fabric is medium to heavy weight material that is woven using a diagonal, or twill, weave that provides its strength and stability. Slightly softer than duck fabric, it is still a highly durable fabric that is resistant to wear and tear.</p>
